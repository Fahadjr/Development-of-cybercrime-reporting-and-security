<h1><b>Development of Cyber Crime Reporting and Cyber Security</b></h1>

With the increased urbanisation and expansion of large cities and towns, the crime graph is fast rising. This remarkable increase in offences and crime in cities is quite concerning. There are robberies, murders, smuggling, rapes, and more crimes that one cannot imagine.

Today's crime reporting solutions are insignificant. Crime reports are still kept on paper, and evidence such as media files are kept on CDs or DVDs. As the case continues, the number of paper documents and evidences grows, making it tough to handle. Also, if a previous case is reopened after a lengthy period of time, it is difficult to locate all of the case's data.

Many crimes committed in India are not reported to the police. A victim may fail to report a crime for a variety of reasons, including a desire not to become involved in a police investigation or a desire not to reveal his identify. Regardless, only the cops are held accountable for every crime.

According to a Times of India investigation, at least one cybercrime was reported every 10 minutes in India in the first six months of 2017, ranging from worldwide ransomware assaults that affected hundreds of systems to phishing and scanning rackets. In 2016, a crime occurred every 12 minutes.
From January through June, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) received reports of 27,482 incidences of cybercrime.
With more Indians getting online, cyber experts say it's vital to put in place key infrastructure to forecast and prevent criminality. A dedicated cyber cell is required to address cyber crimes reported by the public. There is no method to report a cyber crime online in our existing system.

Crime Statistics and Analytics offer a deep and instructive look at several facets of crime. They may be used to identify criminal hotspots and take appropriate action. We may also utilise them to track changes in crime rates so that we can deploy effective crime-fighting methods.
Online Directory of the Most Wanted:
A person having a criminal past may pose a risk to society. There is a need for an internet directory listing of offenders on the police's most wanted list, which will keep a record of all criminals with bounty rewards.
